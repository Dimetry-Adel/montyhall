Description: The package replicates Monty Hall Problem game on the TV show "Let's Make a Deal" where there are three
	doors for a contestant to choose from, one of which has	a car behind it and two have goats. The contestant selects
	a door, then the host opens a door to reveal a goat, and then the contestant is given an opportunity to stay
	with their original selection or switch to the other unopened door. There was a famous  debate about whether
	it was optimal to stay or switch when given the option to switch, so this package for simulation is to
	test both strategies.
